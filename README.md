# Opened Doors Don't Block Light

A lightweight RimWorld mod that fixes an old annoyance: **open doors no longer block light**.  
Colonists can enjoy sunlight or lamp light streaming naturally through open doors, just like you’d expect.

## ✨ Features

- 🔆 **Open doors transmit light** (sunlight, lamps, torches, etc.)
- 🚪 **Closed doors still block light** as usual
- ⚡ **Dynamic updates**: lighting adjusts automatically while a door animates open/closed
- 🛠️ **Configurable update interval** to balance smoothness vs. performance
- 💾 **Safe to add/remove from saves** – no patches to existing defs, only runtime behavior

---

## ⚙️ Settings

Accessible via RimWorld’s **Mod Settings** menu:

- **Enable dynamic lighting**  
  Toggle real-time updates while doors animate.
- **Update interval**  
  How often (in ticks) lighting updates while doors are opening/closing.
  - Lower = smoother lighting but higher CPU use
  - Higher = lighter on performance but slightly less responsive
